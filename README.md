# Car Configuration System
Semester assignment in program development at OsloMet spring 2020

This configuration system has an admin page (super user) where it is possible to create and edit new components,
as well as options for searching the list and file processing of serialized files in their own thread.
The program has a user page (end user) where automotive products with components and various customizations
can be created. This system supports price for each component / fitting and calculation of total price. It is
possible to save lists of products to csv file and get list of previously completed configured products.
The concept of user and superuser is included on two login pages with the possibility of creating new
users and super users. Admin must have a valid employee number. Information about logging in to the program is below.
